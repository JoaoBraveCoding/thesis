Despite the multiple iterations and improvements  that have been done to the Bitcoin dissemination protocol since its introduction, there are still  some aspects that need to be improved.
As Bitcoin becomes more popular and new clients join the system, it is fundamental to have an efficient and robust dissemination substrate for the network to function properly.
%Given the current size of the network and the introduction of new clients to the system is of utmost importance that the new systems are efficient without hurting the resilience of the system.
In this paper, we took some steps in this direction by improving the existing algorithm to do a more selective dissemination.
Our improvements allow to save, 10.2\% of the current bandwidth used and 41.5\% of the number of messages exchanged without compromising the robustness of the current approach.

As future work, we plan to leverage more detailed membership information to build more efficient dissemination paths.
