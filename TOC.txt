		Summary:

		Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System - This paper introduced Bitcoin to the world it talks about some specifications but doesn’t go in-depth.
		Information Propagation in Bitcoin Network - This paper talks about some of the aspects of Bitcoin Network protocol a little more in-depth.
		Discovering Bitcoin’s Public Topology and Influential Nodes - There is a section in this paper that explains how nodes connect to new nodes.
		Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin’s Peer-to-Peer Network - This explains well how the membership of Bitcoin works
	
	Bitcoin and Blockchain vulnerabilities:	
		Relay related vulnerabilities:
		
			Information Propagation in Bitcoin Network - This paper talks about information eclipsing it’s not a proper attack but it’s a defect.
			Secure Peer Sampling Service: the Mosquito Attack - This paper talks about a attack performed in peer sampling networks.
			Proximity Awareness Approach to Enhance Propagation Delay on the Bitcoin Peer-to-Peer Network

		Membership related vulnerabilities:

			Hijacking Bitcoin: Routing Attacks on Cryptocurrencies - This papers talks about two different attacks (Partitioning attack and Delay attack).
			Dandelion: Redesigning the Bitcoin Network for Anonymity
			Incentives Build Robustness in BitTorrent
			Do Incentives Build robustness in BitTorrent?

		Summary:
